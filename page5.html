            Ya I literally cannot wait for prom, like I am soooo excited. We are going to have so much fun with eachother. <br>Ok now I don't know if you remember this image, but I sent it to you a long time ago and you loved it :) and said how you thought it was so cute and sweet that I would send you photos of the sunset. I remember that was the moment when I was like, wow I really like this girl. So in honor of that guess the name of the school that I'm at in that photo. The school name is just the name of the city. Look at the image closely. Research if you have to lololol.
