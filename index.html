            Ok Annie sooo I really didn't have enough time to buy anything that I wanted to give you because I am sooo busy, but when you come down for prom I'll give you your B-day present :) BUT ANYWAYS, it's your birthday and I'm not going to tell you happy birthday yet because you have to complete the adventure in order for me to do that :) so this is how it goes, each page is going to have either a word you have to guess (with a hint of course) or just something you have to complete in order to get to the next page. I hope you enjoy this a lot, so get ready, get set, GO!!!!
